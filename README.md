#A Node Server

Week 7 Wednesday at Makers Academy

###Notes

This project was another small setup to familiarise myself with Node. We used
the Boris Bikes project as a basis to try to setup some testing. 

###Technologies

Testing frameworks were the drive behind this repo, and they proved difficult
to setup:

- Mocha
- CasperJS
- Chai

###Lessons Learned

- There is a huge amount of value in setting up Grunt as your automation
  framework. 

###Improvements

Since this was a small test setup, no further work is desired.
